# digitrecognition / Python 3.x
## Introduction
This project is a machine learning implementation in Python applied to the MNIST database.
The library is, however, easily customizable and is built to be general purpose.

As aforementioned, along with the network architecture, this project also provides the user with
an MNIST module based on the network. It also has a draw module for user-created testing
input.

The MNIST dataset is not provided in this repository, and must be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

## Results
The attempted networks achieved an 92-95% accuracy on the MNIST testing dataset.
